    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Tech -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page interactive dashboard with a fixed left-side navigation for easy exploration. The structure prioritizes demonstrating direct role-fit over a simple chronological resume. The user is first presented with a high-level profile, then an interactive "Role Alignment" section that explicitly maps Sneha's experience to the three core responsibilities from the job description (Coaching, Operations, Insights). This directly answers the hiring manager's primary question of suitability. Subsequent sections provide a deeper, more traditional dive into her career journey, a visual matrix of her skills, and the full cover letter. This user flow is designed for efficiency, guiding the reviewer from a compelling summary to concrete, role-specific evidence, making a stronger case than a static document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Role Alignment: Info -> Job responsibilities vs. Sneha's experience. Goal -> Compare & demonstrate fit. Viz -> Interactive tabs/cards. Interaction -> Click to reveal specific, re-contextualized examples from her CV. Justification -> Directly maps qualifications to needs in a scannable, engaging format. Library -> Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS.
        2. Skills Matrix: Info -> Core P&C and technical skills. Goal -> Organize and visualize capabilities. Viz -> Radar chart for competencies, lists for technical skills. Interaction -> The chart provides an immediate visual summary of her strengths. Justification -> A radar chart offers a more holistic and impactful view of her balanced skill set than a simple list. Library -> Chart.js.
        3. Career Journey: Info -> Chronological work history. Goal -> Inform and provide context. Viz -> Vertical timeline. Interaction -> Minimal, clean presentation for readability. Justification -> A timeline is the most intuitive format for chronological data. Library -> HTML/CSS/Tailwind.
        All visualizations and interactions are designed to build a narrative of a candidate who is not just a recruiter, but a budding P&C generalist, perfectly suited for the role.

                    <p>I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the People Experience & Delivery Partner role at Google DeepMind. The opportunity to contribute to a world-class employee experience at a company at the forefront of AI innovation is particularly compelling. My background as a trusted advisor in talent management and operational delivery has equipped me with a unique skill set to support the dynamic needs of your leaders and managers.</p>
                    <p>In my current role, I serve as a <strong>trusted advisor</strong> to a broad range of hiring managers, providing dynamic coaching on hiring strategies, selection panels, and best practices. This experience has honed my ability to provide responsive guidance on complex people topics, from improving diversity outcomes to resolving nuanced interpersonal challenges. Furthermore, I have a proven track record of <strong>operational excellence</strong>, having independently managed and streamlined end-to-end processes, and contributed to the design and delivery of training programs for interview panels—a skill that I believe directly aligns with the role’s focus on building manager capability.</p>
                    <p>My approach is consistently data-informed, which is essential for identifying systemic issues and developing effective solutions. I have leveraged data from ATS platforms to conduct <strong>in-depth analysis</strong>, share key themes, and drive process improvements. My ongoing professional development in Talent Analytics and my Lean Professional certification further demonstrate my commitment to using a data-driven approach to enhance the employee lifecycle. I am confident that my experience in identifying trends and making recommendations can be directly applied to analyzing broader employee experience data.</p>
                    <p>The opportunity to support Google DeepMind’s mission, particularly its commitment to safety and ethics, is a powerful motivator. My experience in embedding <strong>equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)</strong> principles into core processes, combined with my proficiency in using AI-enabled tools, aligns with your values. I am eager to contribute my skills to your team and help cultivate a high-performing and inclusive culture.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this opportunity further.</p>
